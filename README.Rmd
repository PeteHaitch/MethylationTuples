R package: MethylationTuples
---

__MethylationTuples__ provides tools for analysing, managing, and visualising 
methylation patterns at genomic tuples.

## Installation

You can get the development version from GitHub. You will also need to install 
the development version of [__DSArray__](www.github.com/PeteHaitch/DSArray).

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/DSArray")
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/MethylationTuples")
```

## What the hell do I do with this?

__MethylationTuples__ was initially developed to work hand-in-hand with 
[__methtuple__](www.github.com/PeteHaitch/methtuple) to analyse counts of DNA 
methylation patterns at tuples of genomic loci. In particular, I developed 
__methtuple__ and __MethylationTuples__ to analyse the _co-methylation_ of CpGs 
that exist on the same DNA fragment.

__TODO:__ Expand upon this and what __MethylationTuples__ has become

## Quick demo

__TODO__

## Have a feature request, need help, or want to get involved?

welcome. Please make any pull requests against the master branch at [https://github.com/PeteHaitch/MethylationTuples](https://github.com/PeteHaitch/MethylationTuples) 
and file issues at
