# For submission to \Bioconductor{}

These are issues that must be addressed either before or during the 
\Bioconductor{} submission process.

## Package name

I'm concerned the `r Rpackage("MethylationTuples")` name might be a bit long 
and clumsy.

I need to settle on a package name. `r Rpackage("MethylationTuples")` mimics 
the `r Githubpkg("PeteHaitch/GenomicTuples")` that it depends upon. It is also 
similar to \software{methtuple}, whose output files this package reads in and 
works with.

On a minor note: that \software{methtuple} is singular, whereas both 
`r Githubpkg("PeteHaitch/GenomicTuples")` and `r Rpackage("MethylationTuples")` 
are plural, grates on me.

Possible alternatives:  `r Rpackage("MethTuples")`, other?
