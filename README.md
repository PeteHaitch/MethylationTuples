[![Project Status: Wip - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

R package: MethylationTuples
----------------------------

**MethylationTuples** provides tools for analysing, managing, and visualising methylation patterns at genomic tuples.

Installation
------------

You can get the development version from GitHub. It depends on the [**DSArray**](www.github.com/PeteHaitch/DSArray).

``` r
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/DSArray")
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/MethylationTuples")
```

What the hell do I do with this?
--------------------------------

**MethylationTuples** was initially developed to work hand-in-hand with [**methtuple**](www.github.com/PeteHaitch/methtuple) to analyse counts of DNA methylation patterns at tuples of genomic loci. In particular, I developed **methtuple** and **MethylationTuples** to analyse the *co-methylation* of CpGs that exist on the same DNA fragment.

**TODO:** Expand upon this and what **MethylationTuples** has become

Quick demo
----------

**TODO**
